## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Move windows between displays instantly
  - `⌃⌥⌘→` Move to next display
  - `⌃⌥⌘←` Move to previous display
- **Customizable Hotkeys**: Configure modifier keys (Control, Option, Shift, Command)
- **Menu Bar Integration**: Lightweight, stays out of your way

### Display Memory (v1.1+)
- **Automatic Position Saving**: Remembers window positions every 5 seconds
- **Smart Restoration**: Automatically restores windows when external displays reconnect
- **Sleep/Wake Support**: Works seamlessly after waking from sleep
- **Multi-Window Support**: Handles multiple windows per app individually

## Why WindowSmartMover?

### The Problem with Existing Solutions

Most window management apps are either:
- **Too heavy**: Packed with features you don't need
- **Closed source**: You can't verify what they're doing
- **Cloud-dependent**: Require accounts and subscriptions

WindowSmartMover is:
- ✅ **Simple**: Does one thing well
- ✅ **Open Source**: Full transparency
- ✅ **Privacy-First**: Everything stays on your Mac
- ✅ **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage
- ✅ **Free**: No subscriptions, no ads

### My Motivation

While aware of competing solutions like Rectangle and Magnet, I deliberately chose to "reinvent the wheel" for several reasons:

**Learning by Doing**
- Deep understanding comes from implementation, not just usage
- SwiftUI and macOS app development require hands-on experience
- Building from scratch reveals architectural decisions and trade-offs

**Right-Sized Solution**
- Existing tools are feature-rich but over-specified for my needs
- Sometimes a focused, minimal solution is more maintainable
- Complete control over features and future direction

This project embodies the philosophy: **understand deeply by building yourself**.

## Installation

### Requirements
- macOS 14.0 or later
- Accessibility permissions (required for window control)

### Download & Install

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/zembutsu/WindowSmartMover/releases)
2. Move `WindowSmartMover.app` to `/Applications/`
3. Launch the app
4. Grant Accessibility permissions when prompted:
   - System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
   - Enable WindowSmartMover

## Usage

### Basic Window Movement
1. Make sure a window is active (click on it)
2. Press `⌃⌥⌘→` to move to the next display
3. Press `⌃⌥⌘←` to move to the previous display

### Automatic Window Restoration
1. Use your external display normally
2. When you disconnect (or sleep):
   - Windows automatically move to the main display
3. When you reconnect:
   - Windows automatically restore to their original positions

### Customizing Hotkeys
1. Click the menu bar icon
2. Select "Keyboard Shortcut Settings..."
3. Choose your preferred modifier keys
4. Restart the app

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- macOS 14.0+ SDK

### Build Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zembutsu/WindowSmartMover.git
cd WindowSmartMover

# Open in Xcode
open WindowSmartMover.xcodeproj

# Build and run (⌘R)
```

### Creating a Release Build

1. In Xcode: `Product → Archive`
2. Click `Distribute App`
3. Select `Copy App`
4. Choose export location

## How It Works

### Display Memory Technology
- **Periodic Snapshots**: Window positions saved every 5 seconds
- **CGWindowID Identification**: Each window uniquely identified
- **Display Detection**: Monitors display configuration changes via `NSApplication.didChangeScreenParametersNotification`
- **Smart Matching**: Restores windows based on app name + window ID

### Technical Stack
- **Language**: Swift 6.2
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Window Control**: Accessibility API (AXUIElement)
- **Display Management**: CoreGraphics (CGWindow, NSScreen)
- **Hotkey Registration**: Carbon Event Manager

## Known Limitations

- Some apps (e.g., system preferences) may not support window movement via Accessibility API
- Fullscreen windows cannot be moved
- Display reconnection timing may vary by hardware (1.5-2s stabilization delay)

## Troubleshooting

### Windows not moving
- Verify Accessibility permissions are granted
- Try restarting the app
- Some apps don't support programmatic window control

### Automatic restoration not working
- Check Console logs (click menu bar icon → "Show Debug Info")
- Ensure external display is properly detected
- Try manual window movement first to verify permissions

## Roadmap

- [ ] Per-display restoration timing configuration
- [ ] Optional: Disable verbose logging in release builds
- [ ] Window size restoration (currently position only)
- [ ] Support for more than 2 displays
- [ ] Preferences for snapshot interval

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This project was created as a practical solution to a real problem, and maintained as a learning resource.

### Development Philosophy
- **Simplicity First**: Resist feature creep
- **Privacy Matters**: No telemetry, no cloud
- **Readable Code**: Clear over clever
- **User Agency**: Give users control

## Development Process & AI Usage

This project was developed with assistance from Claude AI (Anthropic). I want to be transparent about this approach and my reasoning.

### Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

I've been fortunate to work with open source technologies for over 30 years—from the early internet days to Linux, Virtualization, Cloud Computing, Docker, and beyond. The knowledge and code shared freely by countless developers made my career possible. Using AI trained on open source code without acknowledgment would feel like forgetting where I came from.

### Learning, Not Replacing

I used AI as a **learning accelerator** to explore SwiftUI, a framework I hadn't worked with before:

- I identified the problem (display coordinate memory on reconnection)
- I defined all requirements and architectural decisions
- AI generated initial code structures and API examples
- I read and understood every line of generated code
- I debugged, refined, and made all final decisions

This mirrors how I learned in the 1990s: reading others' code, asking questions in forums, and building on shared knowledge. The tools changed, but the learning process remains the same.

### Why Share This?

I'm sharing this development approach for a few reasons:

**Transparency**: The community deserves to know how projects are built, especially when new tools are involved.

**For students**: If you're learning to code, know that using AI as a learning tool is okay—as long as you understand what you're building. Don't copy-paste. Read, understand, modify, and make it yours.

**For fellow developers**: I don't claim this is the "right" way. It's simply my way of balancing learning new technologies with years of experience in software development. Your approach may differ, and that's perfectly valid.

### A Note of Respect

To developers who built their skills entirely through manual effort: I deeply respect that path. This isn't about claiming my approach is superior—it's about being honest regarding the tools I used. The open source community thrives on honesty, sharing, and mutual respect. I hope this project reflects those values, even if the development process looks different from what came before.
